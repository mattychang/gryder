# gryderlab

Contains scripts used in RNA-seq: downloading samples from GEO, analysis.

Basic plots: heatmaps, bubble plots, GSEA plot, volcano plot (can do only if you have multiple samples under the same condition). If you find a target/hit, you can show the difference in expression between conditions using heatmap/bubble plot/box plot.
