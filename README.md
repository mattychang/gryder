Analysis scripts used in RNA-seq and ChIP-seq.

## RNA-seq
`buildTPM.R` builds an expression (TPM) matrix from .tdf files.

`Heat_PCA_GSEA.R` builds heatmaps, PCA plots, GSEA ranklist from the expression (TPM) matrix.

`gatherGSEA.R` overlaps GSEA plots.

`Heat_more.R` makes more heatmaps and other plots.

## ChIP-seq
